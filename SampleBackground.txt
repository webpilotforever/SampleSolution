Summary:
The office of the Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) coordinates live test events for weapons systems to confirm they work as expected in an operational environment. Results are reported annually to Congress. DOT&E allocates funds for assessments to Operational Test Agencies (OTAs) based on Concept of Operations (CONOPS) submitted at the beginning of the calendar year. The Cybersecurity Assessment Program (CAP) team replaced the paper-based CONOPS development and approval process with an application designed to improve communication, scheduling, reporting and analysis. With the creation of the DOT&E Cybersecurity Assessment Program Exchange (DCAPX), the CAP team has provided a necessary interface between DOT&E and representatives from the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command, the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, the Navy's Commander Operational Test and Evaluation Force, the Joint Interoperability Test Command, and the Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity.

Background:  The office of the Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) coordinates live test events for weapons systems to confirm they work as expected in an operational environment. Results are reported annually to Congress. DOT&E allocates funds for assessments to Operational Test Agencies (OTAs) based on Concept of Operations (CONOPS) submitted at the beginning of the calendar year. These data drive the assessment events schedule. Unfortunately, OTAs submitted paper-based documents as CONOPS to DOT&E which made the approval dialog difficult, scheduling a manual task, and did not support reporting and analysis goals. The CAP team worked with contractors to build a system to address these deficiencies. 

Accomplishments: 
•	The entire CONOPS development and line-item approval process occurs through custom modules built into the DOT&E Cybersecurity Assessment Program Exchange (DCAPX), an application hosted on its own server farm on SIPRNET. 
•	Through CAP oversight, DCAPX has matured into a first-class example of a secure and recoverable application that supports the full Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). DCAPX is packaged with routines for deployment and diagnosis of securable objects such as sites, lists, and permission groups. Server administrators can easily create synchronized versions of DCAPX in development and production environments. 
•	DCAPX allows for further development to be done by technical or non-technical staff to add modules onto the application for Assessment Management and Research and Analysis. 

Mission Impact Summary: 
With the creation of DCAPX, the CAP team has provided a necessary interface between DOT&E and representatives from the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command, the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, the Navy's Commander Operational Test and Evaluation Force, the Joint Interoperability Test Command, and the Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity. The capability to collaborate and coordinate with so broad an audience, and the ease and flexibility of which new modules may be added makes it easier for OTAs and the CAP team to fulfill operational test and evaluation duties as outlined in Title 10 U.S. Code Sec 139.
